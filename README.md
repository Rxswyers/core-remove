Core Remove
===========
Created by Ruben Swyers

Description
===========
- Recursively deletes cores in a directory that is given as a command line argument.

This would be helpful for any programmer that has the occasional core dump that forgets to remove them.

Warning
=======
>This program was only tested on Linux and should only be used on Linux.


Directions
==========
You will have to compile the program, either just using:
```
gcc coreRemove.c or gcc -o <executable-name> coreRemove.c
```

- `gcc coreRemove.c` will produce an executable file that will be a.out in the directory that you ran it in.
- `gcc -o <executable-name> coreRemove.c` will make an executable file that is the name that you entered after -o

While in terminal you can enter the name of that executable and a directory as a command line argument.
```
<executable> <directory>
```
**If you don't have the ./ in your PATH variable you may have to include ./ in front of the <executable>**
