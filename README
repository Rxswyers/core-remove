Description
C program that will recursively delete cores in a directory that is given as a command line argument.
This would be helpful for any programmer that has the occasional core dumps that forgets to remove them.

Directions
You will have to compile the program, either just using: gcc coreRemove.c or gcc -o <whatever you want to name the executable> coreRemove.c

gcc coreRemove.c will produce an executable file that will be a.out in the directory that you ran it in.
gcc -o <whatever you want the name of the executable to be> coreRemove.c will make an executable file that is the name that you entered after -o

While in terminal you can enter the name of that executable and a directory as a command line argument.
<executable> <directory>
If you don't have the ./ in your PATH variable you may have to include ./ in front of the <executable>
